# Round Workout Timer
I just decided that I want a customizable workout timer on my laptop. I've been making do with the timer in Google search. I'm using: 

- React JS (Create React App)
- TypeScript
- Twin Macro (Tailwind CSS with styled components)

To run it, you can run it as a typical CRA:
- `npm run start` for development
- `npm run build`, then `serve -s build` to run the build

Warning, it's currently a work in progress, and it's pretty minimal to suit my current use case. I'll sort the bugs out sometime this week
